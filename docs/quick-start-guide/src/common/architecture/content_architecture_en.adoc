This architecture consists of three hosts:

* Controller Node (*_controller_*)
* Gateway Node (*_network_*)
* Compute Node (*_compute1_*)

The _MidoNet Network State Database (NSDB)_ uses
https://zookeeper.apache.org/[ZooKeeper]
and
http://www.datastax.com/documentation/cassandra/2.0/cassandra/gettingStartedCassandraIntro.html[Cassandra]
to store network topology and state information. The NSDB components can be
installed on separate hosts, but this guide assumes them to be installed on all
three nodes (*_controller_*, *_network_*, *_compute1_*).

The _MidoNet Agent (Midolman)_ has to be installed on all nodes where traffic
enters or leaves the virtual topology, in this guide this are the *_network_*
and *_compute1_* nodes.

The _Midonet API_ can be installed on a separate host, but this guide assumes it
to be installed on the *_controller_* node.

The _Midonet Command Line Interface (CLI)_ can be installed on a separate host,
but this guide assumes it to be installed on the *_controller_* node.

The _Midonet Neutron Plugin_ replaces the ML2 Plugin and has to be installed on
all three nodes (*_controller_*, *_network_*, *_compute1_*).
